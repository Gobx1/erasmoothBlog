									<h3 class="major">History</h3>
									<p>Inhabited since prehistoric times, the earliest populations in Finland were organised around hunting, fishing and agriculture. For several centuries, Finland was a battleground between its powerful neighbours, Sweden and Russia. Annexed by Sweden in the 12th century, it remained under Swedish rule until 1809, when it was ceded to Russia and became an autonomous Grand Duchy. Despite Russian rule, the Finns retained their unique language and culture. In 1917, taking advantage of the Russian Revolution, Finland proclaimed its independence. However, its recent history has been marked by hardship, notably the Winter War against the Soviet Union in 1939-1940. Today, Finland is known for its high-performing education system, its commitment to social rights and its cultural identity deeply linked to nature and the sauna.</p>
